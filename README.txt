## Overview

**Project Title**:
Anime Recommender Program

**Project Description**:
A program written in Java that recommends new anime shows for you to watch
based on the genres of the shows you've seen before

**Project Goals**:
To learn Java using the W3 School's tutorials and to
write a working program that can print recommendations 
into the terminal based on a list of seen shows.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download the Main.java file
2. Compile it in your terminal of choice
3. Run the program

Instructions for using the current version of the software:

1. Add any shows you've seen to the 'finishedShows' list. Include the show's name, genre and number of episodes
2. Add any shows you want to see to the 'newShows' list. Include the same information as seen in the finishedShows
3. Save the new changes to the code and run it to receive recommendations based on the genres you've recently watched

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio Code (Most recent version)
* Java SDK (Most recent version)
* Java extensions for Visual Studio Code (Most recent versions)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add functionality to allow the user to add items into the finished and newShow lists before
      showing recommendations
* [ ] Add functionality to recommend shows based on episode count as well as genre based on user input
* [ ] Add functionality to have the program read/write the lists to a JSON file for storage of data
